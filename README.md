Yes, it is legally possible to create a streamlined licensing process where the repository name itself serves as the title for the songs uploaded. This way, users can upload their MP3 files or music files in ANY FORMAT without needing to reference each song individually in the license agreement. Here‚Äôs how you can structure your README to reflect this approach:

# [Repository Name] Music License Repository

Welcome to the **[Repository Name]** Music License Repository! This platform allows you to upload your music files in any format, which will be automatically covered by our custom music license agreement.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly repository where artists can securely license their music. This allows them to protect their creative works without the stress of copyright issues. By using this platform, artists can focus on making more music and expressing their creativity. They can choose to monetize their work later if they wish, but for now, they can enjoy peace of mind knowing their creations are safe.

## How It Works

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. You can name it after yourself or your entity (e.g., Your Name or Your Entity Name).
   
2. **Add This README.md**: Copy this [README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaumaturgists/Music-License-Repository/refs/heads/main/README.md) file and fill in the necessary information. Then, add it to your repository to provide context for your music files.

3. **Upload Your Music Files**: Upload your music files (in formats like MP3, WAV, etc.) to your repository.

4. **Automatic Licensing**: By uploading your music files, you automatically agree to the terms of the [Custom Music License Agreement](#custom-music-license-agreement) outlined below.

5. **Get Started**: Your music is now licensed for use under the specified terms, allowing you to focus on creating more works!
