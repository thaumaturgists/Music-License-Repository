In GitHub I created a TODO file in my root that way I can keep up with what I am doing. What should the format be?
```
==================================================

That’s a smart move, having a clear, organized TODO file at the root of your repository adds a great layer of project transparency and self-accountability. Since your work spans creative and technical dimensions, a flexible yet structured format will help you stay focused. Here's a style that blends clarity, prioritization, and visual flow:

### ✅ Suggested Format for Your `TODO.md`

```markdown

### ✨ Tips to Enhance Your Flow
- Use **sections by status** to stay focused.
- Keep tasks short but evocative—think of them like commit messages.
- Consider linking to related files or folders in your repo for quick access.
- If you're feeling thematic, each section could have its own icon—feathers, halos, constellations…
