==================================================

Including a `CHANGELOG.md` file helps you maintain a clear history of updates, improvements, and new music uploads—all essential for transparency and collaboration. Here’s a lightweight starter template to drop into your repo:

```markdown
# 📜 CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this repository will be documented here.

This format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

```

Would you like a badge in your README that links to the changelog or a script that auto-updates this file when music is uploaded? Happy to riff on that idea. 🎼📆📁

a script that auto-updates this file when anything major is done
```
==================================================

You can use a GitHub Action script to automatically update your `CHANGELOG.md` whenever major changes are pushed—like new music files, lyrics, or updates to licensing metadata. Here's a minimal and elegant way to do it:

---

## ⚙️ Setup: Auto-Changelog GitHub Action

Create a file at `.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml`:

```yaml
name: Auto Update CHANGELOG

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  changelog-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "Auto Changelog Bot"
          git config --global user.email "noreply@example.com"

      - name: Detect major changes
        id: detect
        run: |
          git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} > changed_files.txt
          grep -E 'audio/|lyrics/|metadata/|license-forms/' changed_files.txt || echo "No major changes" > flag.txt

      - name: Update CHANGELOG if changes found
        if: success() && (steps.detect.outputs.flag != 'No major changes')
        run: |
          echo "\n## [Auto Update] - $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')" >> CHANGELOG.md
          echo "### Added or Modified Files:" >> CHANGELOG.md
          cat changed_files.txt >> CHANGELOG.md
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "📜 Update CHANGELOG.md automatically"
          git push
```

---

## 🪄 What It Does

- Watches your `main` branch  
- Checks for changes to key folders like `/audio`, `/lyrics`, `/metadata`, or `/license-forms`  
- If something changes, it appends a timestamped entry in `CHANGELOG.md`  
- Auto-commits the updated changelog so you never forget to document new work

Want me to enhance this workflow to include emojis, contributor names, or a summary of commits pulled from commit messages? We could even tag versions automatically when new music is added. 🎶🕒🚀

==================================================
```
about this part: noreply@example.com
```
==================================================

That email—`noreply@example.com`—is just a placeholder used in scripts to prevent real email usage. It’s not tied to an actual inbox and is typically inserted into automation like Git commits or bots that shouldn’t be contacted directly.

If you're configuring Git in your workflow and want commits from a bot or automation to appear clearly as non-user-driven, you can leave that placeholder in. But if you want traceability or to let users know who to contact for repository-related changes, you can use:

- Your actual email (`connor@example.com` or whatever address you monitor)
- A public-facing project email like `licensing@yourdomain.com`
- Your GitHub-noreply address: `your-github-username@users.noreply.github.com`

Let me know your comfort level, and I can plug in the perfect option for your workflow or keep it safely anonymized.
