GitHub actions trying to update my changelog
```
==================================================

If your GitHub Actions workflow is trying to update the changelog and encountering repository rule violations, you'll need to adjust your workflow to comply with the repository's rules. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. **Use a Separate Branch**: Modify your GitHub Actions workflow to create a new branch for the changelog update instead of pushing directly to the `main` branch. After the update, you can create a pull request from this branch to `main`.

2. **Ensure Signed Commits**: If the repository requires commits to be signed, you can configure your GitHub Actions to sign commits. You can do this by setting up GPG keys in your workflow. Here's a basic example of how to sign commits in a GitHub Actions workflow:

   ```yaml
   - name: Set up GPG
     run: |
       echo "${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}" | gpg --import
       git config --global user.signingkey <your-gpg-key-id>
       git config --global commit.gpgSign true

   - name: Commit changes
     run: |
       git add CHANGELOG.md
       git commit -m "Update changelog" -S
   ```

   Make sure to store your GPG private key in GitHub Secrets.

3. **Check Status Checks**: Ensure that any required status checks are passing before attempting to merge the pull request. You may need to adjust your workflow to wait for these checks to complete.

4. **Review Repository Rules**: Familiarize yourself with the specific rules set for the repository. You can find these rules in the repository settings under "Branch protection rules." This will help you understand what is required for successful updates.

5. **Create a Pull Request**: After making the changes in a separate branch, use the GitHub Actions workflow to create a pull request automatically. You can use the `gh` CLI tool or GitHub's REST API to create the pull request.

By following these steps, you should be able to update your changelog through GitHub Actions while adhering to the repository's rules.

```
So, make a gpg key, label it github actions repo, and use that key in my actions?
```
==================================================

Yes, that's correct! Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a GPG key, label it for your GitHub Actions, and use it in your workflow:

### Step 1: Create a GPG Key

1. **Install GPG**: If you don't have GPG installed, you can download it from [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) or use a package manager.

2. **Generate a GPG Key**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create your key. You can choose the default options for most prompts. Make sure to remember the passphrase you set.

3. **List Your GPG Keys**:
   After generating the key, list your keys to find the key ID:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
   ```
   Note the key ID (the long string after `sec`).

4. **Export Your GPG Private Key**:
   Export your private key to use in GitHub Actions:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <your-key-id> > private-key.asc
   ```

### Step 2: Add the GPG Key to GitHub Secrets

1. **Open Your GitHub Repository**: Go to the repository where your GitHub Actions are set up.

2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab.

3. **Add a New Secret**:
   - Go to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - Click on "New repository secret".
   - Name the secret (e.g., `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`) and paste the contents of `private-key.asc` into the value field.
   - Click "Add secret".

### Step 3: Update Your GitHub Actions Workflow

Now, you can update your GitHub Actions workflow to use the GPG key for signing commits. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```yaml
name: Update Changelog

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  update-changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up GPG
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}" | gpg --import --batch --yes
          git config --global user.signingkey <your-key-id>
          git config --global commit.gpgSign true

      - name: Update changelog
        run: |
          # Your commands to update the changelog go here
          echo "Changelog updated" >> CHANGELOG.md

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "Update changelog" -S
          git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/your-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request

After committing the changes to a new branch, you can create a pull request to merge those changes into the `main` branch. You can automate this step using the GitHub CLI or GitHub API if desired.

### Important Notes

- **Passphrase**: If your GPG key has a passphrase, you may need to handle that in your workflow. You can use the `gpg --batch --passphrase` option to automate this, but be cautious about security.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Ensure that your repository's branch protection rules allow for pull requests and that the required status checks are met.

By following these steps, you should be able to sign your commits in GitHub Actions successfully!

==================================================
```
update update-changelog.yml
```
==================================================

Here’s an updated version of your `update-changelog.yml` file that incorporates the use of a GPG key for signing commits. This version assumes you have already set up a GPG key and added it to your GitHub repository secrets as `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`. 

### Updated `update-changelog.yml`

```yaml
name: Auto Update CHANGELOG

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  changelog-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Generate changed files list
        id: detect
        run: |
          git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} > files.txt
          echo "::set-output name=has_changes::$(if grep -qE '^(audio/|lyrics/|metadata/|license-forms/)' files.txt; then echo 'true'; else echo 'false'; fi)"

      - name: Append to CHANGELOG under [Unreleased]
        if: steps.detect.outputs.has_changes == 'true'
        run: |
          TODAY=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
          # Insert a new dated subsection immediately after "## [Unreleased]"
          awk -v date="$TODAY" '
            BEGIN { inserted=0 }
            /^## \[Unreleased\]/ && !inserted {
              print
              print ""
              print "### " date
              print "- Added or Modified Files:"
              while ((getline line < "files.txt") > 0) print "- " line
              print ""
              inserted=1
              next
            }
            { print }
          ' CHANGELOG.md > tmp && mv tmp CHANGELOG.md

      - name: Set up GPG
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}" | gpg --import --batch --yes
          git config --global user.signingkey <your-key-id>
          git config --global commit.gpgSign true

      - name: Commit & push changelog update
        if: steps.detect.outputs.has_changes == 'true'
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "Auto Changelog Bot"
          git config --global user.email "noreply@example.com"
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -S -m "chore: update CHANGELOG for $TODAY" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }} HEAD:main
```

### Key Changes Made:

1. **GPG Setup**: Added a step to import the GPG key from the GitHub secret and configure Git to use it for signing commits.
   - Replace `<your-key-id>` with the actual key ID of your GPG key.

2. **Signed Commit**: The commit command now includes the `-S` flag to sign the commit.

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that your GPG key is properly set up and that you have added the public key to your GitHub account to allow for verification of signed commits.
- If your GPG key has a passphrase, you may need to handle that in your workflow, but for security reasons, it's generally recommended to use a key without a passphrase for automated processes like this.
- Test the workflow in a safe environment to ensure everything works as expected before deploying it to your main branch.

how to make a key without a pssphrase?
```
==================================================

Creating a GPG key without a passphrase is straightforward. However, it's important to note that while this makes automation easier (like in CI/CD environments), it also reduces the security of the key. If someone gains access to the private key, they can use it without any additional authentication. Here’s how to create a GPG key without a passphrase:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a GPG Key Without a Passphrase

1. **Open Terminal**: Launch your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Generate a New GPG Key**:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```

3. **Select Key Type**:
   You will be prompted to select the type of key you want. The default option (RSA and RSA) is usually fine. Just press `Enter` to select it.

4. **Set Key Size**:
   You will be asked to specify the key size. The default is typically 2048 bits, but you can choose 4096 bits for stronger security. Enter your desired key size and press `Enter`.

5. **Set Expiration**:
   You can choose whether the key should expire. If you want it to never expire, you can select the option for no expiration. Press `Enter` after making your selection.

6. **User ID Information**:
   You will be prompted to enter your name and email address. This information will be associated with the key. Fill in the details and press `Enter`.

7. **Passphrase**:
   When prompted for a passphrase, simply press `Enter` without typing anything. This will create the key without a passphrase.

8. **Key Generation**:
   GPG will generate your key. Once it's done, you will see a confirmation message with your key ID.

### Example Command Sequence

Here’s how the command sequence might look in your terminal:

```bash
$ gpg --full-generate-key
# Select (1) RSA and RSA
# Key size: 2048 or 4096
# Expiration: 0 (for no expiration)
# Name: Your Name
# Email: your.email@example.com
# Passphrase: (press Enter)
```

### Important Considerations

- **Security Risks**: A GPG key without a passphrase is less secure. If someone gains access to your private key file, they can use it without any restrictions. Consider the security implications before proceeding.
- **Backup Your Key**: Make sure to back up your GPG key pair (both public and private keys) in a secure location.
- **Use in Automation**: This setup is particularly useful for automated processes, such as CI/CD pipelines, where manual intervention is not feasible.

By following these steps, you can create a GPG key without a passphrase, making it suitable for use in automated environments like GitHub Actions.
