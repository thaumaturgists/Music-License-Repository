I set everything up, but this happened when I tried to make a change in my repo
0s Run git diff --name-only 0eb38276fa3c229ed4e8031a60b52cab3d1f8efe ae186212726d492bef65c2a1a653653b6ceff538 > changed_files.txt fatal: bad object 0eb38276fa3c229ed4e8031a60b52cab3d1f8efe Error: Process completed with exit code 128.

```
==================================================

Thanks for flagging that, this error usually means GitHub Actions is trying to run a `git diff` between two commits, but the “before” commit (`0eb382...`) either doesn’t exist locally in the checkout or wasn’t fetched correctly.

Here’s a quick fix to make your workflow more robust:

---

## ✅ Update Your Workflow Checkout Step

The issue is that the default `actions/checkout` step only fetches the latest commit. To compare changes reliably, you need to **fetch the full history** or at least the last two commits. Try this:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history so both commits are available
```

Or if you want to be lightweight:

```yaml
with:
  fetch-depth: 2  # Fetch just enough history to compare two commits
```

---

## 🧪 Optional: Add Logging for Debugging

To verify which commits are fetched, you could add:

```yaml
- name: Show recent commits
  run: git log --oneline -n 5
```

---

Once you make that change, your `git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }}` command should work as expected and populate `changed_files.txt` without throwing that fatal error.

Let me know if you’d like help customizing the changelog entry format based on commit messages or triggering a changelog update only for specific types of edits (like audio uploads). 🎶📦🔧


==================================================
```
Do I need to make the changed_files.txt or does it do that for me?
```
==================================================

You don't need to create `changed_files.txt` yourself—it’s automatically generated by the line in your workflow:

```bash
git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} > changed_files.txt
```

This command:
- Compares the file changes between two commits: the one before the push, and the one after
- Lists only the names of changed files
- Redirects that list into a new file called `changed_files.txt`

📂 GitHub Actions runs this in a temporary environment, so you won’t see `changed_files.txt` in your repo unless you explicitly commit and push it (which you likely don’t need to do).

If you'd like that file committed to track changelogs manually or archive it for audits, I can show you how to add a commit step. Otherwise, you’re good to go—Git handles the heavy lifting for you!

Want help refining how that changelog entry looks based on the files it detects? We could add emoji tags or categories like 🎧 audio vs 📝 lyrics.

==================================================
```
where to put this:
- name: Show recent commits run: git log --oneline -n 5
```
==================================================

You’ve got it, Patrick! That debugging line fits perfectly inside your GitHub Action workflow—specifically within the job that analyzes or processes the changelog. Here’s the full context of where to insert it:

### 🛠️ Updated Workflow Snippet (`.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml`)

```yaml
name: Auto Update CHANGELOG

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  changelog-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2  # Ensure we fetch enough history for diff

      - name: Show recent commits
        run: git log --oneline -n 5  # 🧪 This is your debug line

      - name: Set up Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "Auto Changelog Bot"
          git config --global user.email "noreply@example.com"

      - name: Detect major changes
        id: detect
        run: |
          git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} > changed_files.txt
          grep -E 'audio/|lyrics/|metadata/|license-forms/' changed_files.txt || echo "No major changes" > flag.txt

      - name: Update CHANGELOG if changes found
        if: success() && (steps.detect.outputs.flag != 'No major changes')
        run: |
          echo "\n## [Auto Update] - $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')" >> CHANGELOG.md
          echo "### Added or Modified Files:" >> CHANGELOG.md
          cat changed_files.txt >> CHANGELOG.md
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "📜 Update CHANGELOG.md automatically"
          git push
```

### 🧪 What This Line Does

```yaml
- name: Show recent commits
  run: git log --oneline -n 5
```

It prints the five most recent commits in a short format so you can visually confirm which commits are present and available for `git diff`. Super useful for debugging that `fatal: bad object` issue you hit earlier.

Need help turning the commit messages into bullet points in your changelog for extra flair? I can wire that up with style. 🎯📜💫
