==================================================

The error message you're encountering indicates that the repository has certain rules and protections in place that prevent you from pushing directly to the `main` branch. Specifically, it mentions:

1. **Required Status Check**: The repository requires a status check called "Enforce License Acceptance" to pass before changes can be merged.
2. **Protected Branch**: The `main` branch is protected, meaning that direct pushes to it are not allowed.
3. **Pull Request Requirement**: Changes must be made through a pull request (PR).

### Steps to Make a Pull Request

Since you cannot push directly to the `main` branch, you can follow these steps to create a pull request:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   First, create a new branch for your changes. This is where you will make your modifications before submitting a pull request.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**:
   Make the necessary changes to your files in this new branch.

3. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**:
   After making your changes, stage and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of my changes"
   ```

4. **Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository**:
   Push your new branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   After pushing your branch, go to the GitHub repository in your web browser. You should see a prompt to create a pull request for your newly pushed branch. Click on it and fill out the necessary details, then submit the pull request.

6. **Address Any Required Checks**:
   If there are any required status checks (like the "Enforce License Acceptance"), ensure that you comply with them. This may involve accepting a license or passing certain tests.

7. **Review and Merge**:
   Once your pull request is created, it can be reviewed by the repository maintainers. If everything is in order, they can merge your changes into the `main` branch.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully make your changes and submit them for review through a pull request, complying with the repository's rules and protections. If you have any further questions or need assistance with any specific step, feel free to ask!

The error message you're encountering indicates that there are additional repository rules in place that are preventing you from pushing your feature branch. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues and how to resolve them:

### Issues Identified

1. **Required Status Check**: The repository requires a status check called "Enforce License Acceptance" to pass before changes can be merged.
2. **Branch Creation Restrictions**: The repository has restrictions on creating new branches.
3. **Merge Commits Not Allowed**: The branch you are trying to push contains a merge commit, which is not allowed by the repository rules.

### Steps to Resolve the Issues

#### 1. **Check Out a New Branch from Main**
To avoid the merge commit issue, you should create your feature branch directly from the latest commit on the `main` branch. First, ensure your local `main` branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Then, create a new branch from the updated `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch
```

#### 2. **Make Your Changes**
Make the necessary changes in this new branch.

#### 3. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**
Stage and commit your changes without creating a merge commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of my changes"
```

#### 4. **Push Your New Branch**
Now, push your new branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin my-new-feature-branch
```

#### 5. **Create a Pull Request**
After successfully pushing your new branch, go to the GitHub repository in your web browser. You should see a prompt to create a pull request for your newly pushed branch. Click on it and fill out the necessary details, then submit the pull request.

#### 6. **Address Required Checks**
Make sure to comply with any required checks, such as the "Enforce License Acceptance." This may involve accepting a license or passing certain tests.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to create a new branch without merge commits and push it to the repository, allowing you to submit a pull request. If you encounter any further issues or have questions about specific steps, feel free to ask!
